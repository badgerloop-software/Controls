We are the team responsible for the embedded programming side of badgerloop. We will work closely with the software and electrical teams to develop our mechatronic system. This will be your main resource to get things done.

# Code Example

## So you want to make a commit/platformIO
In order to ditch the online ide, we will be using platformIO which has mbed support. PlatformIO allows you to work on the IDE and OS of your choice with well documented configurations. There is an official platformIO ide that is based off of the Atom editor which works nicely and has a built-in serial monitor. If you're more comfortable with other editors i.e. eclipse or visual studio, you can do that too, but it won't be covered.
* Install Atom and the platformIO package [here](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide)
* After platformIO is installed, go to Atom and follow [this](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#quick-start) to install Clang for code completion.
